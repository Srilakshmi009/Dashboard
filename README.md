A Dashboard created on Excel to analyse the data.
I used IPL Dataset which is available on Kaggle website. It contains Data about the matches conducted from 2008 to 2020.
In this project I used six objectives to make the dashboard interactive.
I used Pivot-Tables, Pivot-Charts, Filters, Piecharts, Graphs, Slicers, Hyperlinks.
To avoid unneccessary actions I made this file Read-only. Hpoe you will go through this and like this project.
